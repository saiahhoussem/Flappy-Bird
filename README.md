# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Unity-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game. It was developed to recreate the simple, addictive gameplay while learning Unity game development essentials.
## 🎮 Game Overview

In this Flappy Bird clone, players control a small bird navigating through a series of obstacles (pipes) by tapping or clicking to make the bird "flap" upward. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them or the ground. Each successful pass increases the player’s score.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

    Unity: Game engine for development.
    C#: Programming language used for scripting game mechanics.

## 🚀 Features

    Simple and Intuitive Controls: Just tap or click to make the bird flap.
    Score Tracking: Track the player’s progress through a scoring system.
    Randomized Obstacles: Each run features a new set of randomly positioned pipes.
    Pixel Art Graphics: Inspired by the original Flappy Bird style.

## 📂 Project Structure

    Assets: Contains sprites and scripts.
    Scripts: C# files handling the game logic (bird control, collision detection, score tracking).
    Scenes: Unity scene used in the game (game scene).
